# Module_7_SQL: Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose

For this challenge our manager has asked that we determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We will utilize PostgresSQL to analyize our provided CSV files and generate our initial tables. After looking through our initial data we will generate new tables to show retirement and mentorship information.  

## Results

ERD or Entity Relationship Diagram to visualize the relationship between our datasources
